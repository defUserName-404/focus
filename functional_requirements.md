this is a flutter app, I will choose isar, however if i want it online or choose sync, the architecture should allow it to upgrade. the code should work on contract based with interfaces, use riverpod for state management and get_it for dependency injection. i choose forui since that is very close to shadcn's design aesthetics and makes it very easy to customize. my app should be fully ready in 5-6 hours.  create a full implementaion plan and architecture so it is ready fully within 5-6 hours but keeps the architecture flexible for future improvements
